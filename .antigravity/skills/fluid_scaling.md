# Fluid Scaling (clamp())

Rule: Use `clamp()` CSS functions for fonts so they adapt mathematically to any screen size.

Example: `font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem);`

Reasoning: Ensures typography is perfectly legible on both tiny mobile screens and massive 4K monitors without strict breakpoints.

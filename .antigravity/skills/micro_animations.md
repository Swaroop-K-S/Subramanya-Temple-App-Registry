# Micro-Interaction Rules

Rule 1 (Physics-based Motion): Animations must use standard physics (ease-out for entering, ease-in for exiting).

Hover States: Buttons must scale slightly (hover:scale-105) and triggers a sweep-shine effect.

Feedback: Clicking a button must instantly trigger a visual ripple or press state (active:scale-95).

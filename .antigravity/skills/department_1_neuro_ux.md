*Manipulating user behavior to make the app feel addictive and trustworthy.*

## 1. Hick’s Law Auditor
**Rule**: Reduces the number of choices on screen (like in the Seva lists) to prevent "Choice Paralysis."
**Action**: Max 5-7 items visible at once; use "See More" for the rest.

## 2. Fitts's Law Enforcer
**Rule**: Ensures the distance between the user's thumb and the "Book Now" button is mathematically minimized.
**Action**: Primary actions must be easily accessible (bottom of screen on mobile).

## 3. Trust Signal Engineer
**Rule**: Strategically places security badges, lock icons, and green checkmarks near UPI payment inputs.
**Action**: Add visual reassurance at friction points.

## 4. Loading State Hypnotist
**Rule**: Designs beautiful skeleton loaders and spinners so users don't perceive wait times during API calls.
**Action**: Never show a blank screen. Hypnotize with shimmering skeletons.

## 5. Dopamine Loop Architect
**Rule**: Designs the "Success Page" (Receipt generation) to give a satisfying visual reward after a booking.
**Action**: Confetti, green flash, or satisfying "Check" animation on success.

## 6. Error Empathy Writer
**Rule**: Rewrites technical error messages (e.g., "500 Internal Error") into friendly, apologetic text.
**Action**: "We couldn't connect to the Sanctum" instead of "Server Error".

## 7. Friction Eradicator
**Rule**: Counts the number of clicks required to book a seva and ruthlessly eliminates unnecessary steps.
**Action**: Target < 3 clicks for core workflows.

## 8. Cognitive Bias Strategist
**Rule**: Uses the "Scarcity Effect" (e.g., "Only 3 slots left for Ashlesha Bali") to drive urgent bookings.
**Action**: Highlight limited availability visually.

## 9. Muscle Memory Mapper
**Rule**: Keeps standard buttons (Submit, Cancel, Print) in exact, predictable locations across every page.
**Action**: Consistent button placement (e.g., Positive Right, Negative Left).

## 10. Haptic Feedback Strategist
**Rule**: Triggers micro-vibrations (on mobile) when a user successfully selects a date or submits a form.
**Action**: Use `navigator.vibrate` for tactile confirmation.

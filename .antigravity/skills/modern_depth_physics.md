# Category 2: Modern UI & Depth Perception

## UI/UX Architect
Focuses on flow and intuition.
- Minimize clicking (Max 3 clicks to reach any goal).
- Ensure intuitive user flow and navigation.

## Glassmorphism & Material Expert
Handles premium textures.
- **Deep Glass**: Use `backdrop-blur-xl`, translucent layers, and subtle borders.
- Backgrounds must be textured or gradient-rich, never flat solid colors.

## Shadow & Lighting Director
Simulates 3D levitation.
- Use multi-layered drops-shadows (Ambient + Directional).
- Elements must appear to float based on their elevation/importance.

## Visual Hierarchy Engineer
Directs the user's eye.
- Most important elements must be Largest, Boldest, or most Contrasting.
- Use Size and Weight to guide the user sequence.

## Pixel-Perfect QA Agent
Audits for perfection.
- Audit code for exact border alignments.
- Ensure fractional pixel rendering is handled or avoided for sharpness.
